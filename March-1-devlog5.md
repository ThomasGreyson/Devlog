# Devlog 5: Imagining the Product

At this point in the game I have mostly been wondering about content, leaving the brunt of the hands-on fiddling to studio time where I feel like my problems could be better solved as they come up. That being said, I have finally figured out what sort of vibe I want to give off to AR users with this project: think _How It's Made_ but with more of an in-depth look on historical research than what's covered in 30 seconds of air time. My inspiration for this was a culinary ephemera book I had found at the library, which made the subject (while often accused of being mundane) into a diverse perspective on social history.

I have decided to do a combination of "storybook" AR projects and more traditional point-and-shoot AR triggers by combining the two, literally dissecting a chocolate box for which each component has its own (or multiple) triggers. These triggers will lead to informational slides that will talk about chocolate box design, development, and fun facts along the way, hopefully leading users to reflect more closely on the packaging that the casually throw away every day. The main problem that I've run into at this point is that multiple triggers may not be able to fit together in one spot or that the logistics of ordering my information slides might be a bit difficult, a problem I'll need to further test in studio time.

**while I have not freaking cool graphics to show at this time please take a gander at my pitiful little concept sketches and chocolate box model I have brought in with me today** 

While I'm not entirely sure this project will have any considerable impact, I can a) at least show my family and friends through social media applications that Aurasma flows well with and my grandmother can say "I love it dear". and b) Build on these skills for future projects and careers and at least have this basic knowledge in my back pocket for a rainy day. Overall, I'm content with how this is progressing as it both helps me better understand the potential digital properties history can have and gives me a new perspective from which to view my own MRE research.
