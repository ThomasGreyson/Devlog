# Devlog 6: In Which Our Hero Sits around and Eats Chocolate in the Name of Academia......

For science my good woman, SCIENCE!

....Or you know, augmented reality.

Today, I am sorry to report Shawn, consisted of destroying the last of the edible evidence (its physical essence?) from the new chocolate box of choice and prepping the box for pictures (read AR triggers) for the project. As discussed in last class I'd like to have multiple triggers from one surface and believe this box to be busy enough to do the trick. A Laura Secord Easter praline collection, it died nobly for the cause and has quite a few visuals (colors, easter eggs, logo wraps, etc.) I has since been photo-editing the triggers to be more recognizable in cetrain lights as well as deciding which style of image works best: cropped or uncropped images.

I have also been working out potential kinks in the story-telling aspect of the box; if they're are multiple triggers on one surface which image should go first in the online line-up? Should I have close-ups of specific triggers as well as a general view of the front/back of the box or just the specific cues? I believe when all is said and done I will have around 7-10 triggers/informational pop-ups, however I might make only some of these inofrmational while others be clips/other images, or maybe a combination of both. Either way, I've got my work cut out for me and shall spend the weekend delving further into my AR details.
