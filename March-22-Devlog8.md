# K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple Stupid)

This week has been all about not getting so caught up in the potentials of technology and taking a moment to refresh myself on basic skills. Odd, I know, considering this is a technology class and I should be learning NEW things instead of old ones. Let me explain.

Twice I failed to remember simple things to make my project both easier and more effective: the print screen function and simple file transfer through cables (yes, you can laugh at me for being dense, especially the second thing.) Using Print screen, I can snap pictures of my fully formatted powerpoint slides (complete with chosen design, images, diagrams, and anything else I could need), paste it into paint, and voila! Instant overlay images for my triggers. I'd like to credit Dany for his spark of brilliance as I haven't used print screen in years and forgot all about the function.

The second flaw I am pretty embarassed about.... I've transferred so many things through social media platforms (images, documents, you name it) that I completely forgot my roots, causing a lot of headache over video clips I wanted included in the project- once again, Dany the lifesaver. 

Honestly, I can only say at this point that it's about bringing all aspects of the puzzle together. My overlays have been written and formatted, my triggers uploaded to Aurasma. The next few steps will be the trials and errors I'll encounter in terms of testing final triggers and the like. Wish me luck!
