# Devlog 1: A New Hope

>"Avoid recognizable art categories,
avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be
ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children
will remember all their lives"-Hakim Bey

As one of the last of a transitional period between the internet and the pen-and-paper age, I have a love/hate relationship with technology. I am a part of the last generations to be taught cursive in school, remember not owning a cellphone before age 17, and passing handwritten notes in class. To grow up and use technology was in and of itself a generational act of defiance; parents neither knew nor cared to know how social media or communication systems operated and thus left a new generation free to explore the possibilities.


Nowadays, hoever, there appears to be a backlash against the ways of MSN chat and Facebook. Encouraged to go off the web, or even better, _through_ the web and its very lifeblood (code), I now find myself wanting to learn more about the underbelly of a technology I have so long used and never quite understood. In my first attempt at Command Line alone I inadvertantly opened Skype, causing me to immediately feel a sense of God-like power and achievement: this was not because I felt cool for using the 'back door' approach but simply the sheer fact that it was a new approach (and therefore perspective) for me.

This journal, while an attempt to track my hilarious antics, should also chronicle my struggles with the concepts presented to me in this class, from my unending frustrations at Github to my eternal confusion and the small flicker of comprehension when it comes.

#### Project Development


Overall, I really want to think about the project in terms of Bey's quote that I've included at the top of this entry. I want my experience in this course to not only be educating (the four tutorials alone demonstrated that this class will have a steep learning curve for me) but invigorating as well, a merging of traditional histories with fresh methods of narration. The options that we have already discussed are intriguing, but we have also witnessed/discussed pitfalls (Pirate boxes and trust/malware issues, pprojected walls and their real impact). I believe that I'd be good with any method as long as it delivers the full desired effect:to shock and awe, and to make passersby stop and take note. With more brainstorming and perhaps a closer look at some hidden stories across Ottawa inspiration might come. Until then, I will try to remain observant and open to a new digital perspective.
