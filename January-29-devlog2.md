#Devlog 2-To Be or Not To Be (Silly)

The more I consider this project I think about my own state of affairs as a student and as a professional. Reflecting further on both the course notes and how we discussed digital history skills as critical for resumes in class, I wonder which project I should choose, the ins and outs of both to be explained further in the classroom. Option 1 is to really delve into the guerilla aspect of this course, choosing key spots around Carleton to share some of the unwanted histories of the land. First, there is the matter of squatters being on the land in the early 20th century, not to mention Carleton's location on traditional, unceded Algonquin territory. I would enjoy putting up tents and projecting images of the impoverished lifestyles these campers endured, or even projecting a certain image of indigenous peoples on their tipi (of course collaborating with the Indigenous centre to do so). Another project to consider would be to transform in some way the Carleton 75th anniversary banners that are up around the buildings. With regards to Ottawa in general, all I have seen in terms of building projection have been the 'story of Canada' as told by Canadian Heritage with Parliament as the backdrop. I like the idea of projection as an art form of visual illusion and the re-building of layers from the past, but I am not sure that I necessarily want a very somber subject.

This is where my love of *silliness* gets in the way. I would love to do a fun project based off of the shennanigans we got into during class last week using Aris, revolving around a murder mystery set in 19th century Ottawa (really I want an excuse to develop a story about a maple syrup magnate who drowns in his own vat of syrup but you get the idea).Inspired by RPG game West of Loathing by Assymetric publications, I would want this game to be an intriguing little project that would help get local gamers interested in Ottawa's early history. It could relate topics of interest that aren't necessarily discussed, such as views of race, gender, and early politics, and could also include some conspiracy-theory-level underground tunnel action. However, this is less guerilla than what was originally discussed in class and thus I am at a crossroads.

 For both I would certainly have to understand who should be involved/collaborated with. I question how far I could take my project at Carleton and wonder about the implications of setting something up against university policy while still a student. If I chose the Aris route I would have to make it clear just how far I wanted to push fiction, and if it would hinder my ability to give players a true look at Ottawa through a digital lens. I hope to talk to Shawn about this further later this week or next week, and will definitely make it clear to anyone who likes either idea that they're free to run with me or solo on the project.
