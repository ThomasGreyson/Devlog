# Technology As Medium: Overtaking Traditional Digital Processes by Combining the Creative and Historic

To first begin with the paradata of my project, I will then place this information in the context of digital history theories we had discussed at the beginning of this course in conjunction with my own general observations and discoveries throughout the course period.

## Paradata & Unexplored Avenues

Much of what I had presented to my colleagues on the final day of class has not changed. My project consists of a collection of images infused with different media files in a technology collectively termed as augmented reality. I used the platform Aurasma (now called HP Reveal, a good indicator of where its motivation as technology lies), partially because of its easy use for first-time beginners and also due to the fact that it has both a successful website and application, the latter of which functions both on Android and iPhone. On Andoird along the application had over 1 million downloads, indicating to me the potential for a wider audience who could access my project. While there are certainly more advanced AR platforms out there (most of which I only discovered after a certain amount of digging after choosing HP Reveal), they do not have as much reach among society at large, not to mention having no phone applications available- only websites. While this is not a negative quality at all for those who are greatly interested in augmented reality, it did not suit the purpose of my project, which was to get a well-rounded beginner's experience that was accessible, practical, and not _overly_ technical.

My project consists of seven images of two chocolate boxes, with all images taken from a bird's eye view of seveal box features (e.g. front cover, back, nutritional label, company logo, chocolate tray, etc.)For the sake of avoiding co nfusion, I will be calling these images (as well as the rest of the project's separate parts) by their HP Reveal terms, called triggers. These images are the base image that would be viewed through a phone, tablet, or other device first in order to view the augmented reality file placed on top of the trigger image. These media files, called overlays, are what is triggered upon viewing the chosen image. Choices for potential overlays in the HP Reveal application include images, audio clips, video footage, and 3-dimensional models. Together the triggers and overlays combined as a package are called auras.

For my project, I wanted to attempt an array of triggers which had mixed success. My images were of screen-shot powerpoint slides with information regarding the history of chocolate boxes, the slides being all placed thematically on the box (chocolate's nutritional properties slide placed over the box's nutritional values table, etc.). These slide/images worked very well. I also included 2 videos, one of which worked in tandem with a slide on the same trigger while the other was a bit trickier to track. My final attempt, the audio cip, unfortunately is not in working order. This is difficult to say if it is the type of sound file the clip is rendered in as the application makes no note of what the appropriate format should be.

Overall, this is what my project generally consists of. It originally aimed to convey chocolate box history in a unique, almost story-like way with the unpacking of a chocolate box as a physical action and as a metaphor for unlayering the knowledge set out in the auras. However, due to a number of unforseen bumps in the procress (poor lighting of triggers, bad capturability, limited trigger space on boxes) which could otherwise simply be labelled life, it does not exactly have this ideally-polished look I was striving for. However, these problems do give me a number of ideas for improvement in case I ever wanted to move my project into Beta testing (i.e. use only box fronts for triggers as a collection, for example), which to me is a success in and of itself; rather than seeing the initial project as a failure, it provides me with the inspiration to pursue the subject from a different perspective.

There are, however, some aspects of my project that I did not unpack entirely during my updates given periodically to the class. Ideas of accessibility, aura design, ommitted topics, and digital relevance have not bee touched upon and I wish to take a moment to discuss these subjects in greater detail. Like most of the topics I have listed, accessibility was superficially mentioned in terms of who, on the most basic level, could access my project, this mainly being those who both had access to HP Reveal in some way (i.e. phone and/or laptop owners) and could search for my Auras (which was everyone with the HP Reveal application as all of my auras have been shared publicly). However, this does not mention the targeted user demographic of HP Reveal which, from my research, is a collection of teachers using the app for educational purposes and companies promoting their products using the AR platform to appeal to a more tech-saavy demographic. Both of these groups indicate younger, middle class users, as they would have to have both the technological skills to have heard of AR apps and the income to afford the devices to use it. In addition, there are limitations to how much one can view through the triggers: for instance, my chosen chocolate boxes could not be available in Asia, therefore affecting its ability to be viewed without the help of the online thumbnail trigger. Unfortunately, the thumbnail is not always the most accurate picture, its tracking abilities becoming more polluted the number of times the trigger image gets filtered through. In conjunction with the 1 million + app subscribers and the big-name companies who endorse HP Reveal, these detriments to the AR experience could be seen as balancing out to a not-perfect application with limited accessibility, the same as could be said with many popular platforms out there.

A second aspect I did not entirely flesh out was aura design. As previously mentioned I wrote my text panels for Level 3 readers, or about the same reading level as the government of Canada uses to speak to its citizens. Since I am not fluent in any other language, this restricts my audience to English-fluent users only. I also assume that my audience has encountered a chocolate box before as I do not explain their role in society or go into great descriptive detail. There are other ways I could be exclusionary simply by not realizing it, a good note which would push me even further to explore the idea of future project testing. This could even be furthered by the fact that I chose to omit certain topics regarding my project for certain reasons. For example, some of my choices were simply based on lack of space or relevance to the boxes. For instance, the common theme of cultural messages that were a feature of early box design including images of celebrities and monarchs on box-tops; both my selected boxes were holiday-themed boxes so I stuck with holiday information. Based on my reading level and potential audience (e.g. school children) I also avoided sensitive topics such as racist images and figures that, like many other types of food packaging, were on box covers as logos, tropes, and subservient characters in cover scenes. While this limits the amount of information users can access regarding this topic, the same could be said of any project which omits, but I also felt it was important to note these restrictions up front and be transparent about my own way of thinking/processing of the information.

## Digital Theory & Augmented Reality

Among my first reflections on my project I became concerned that I, like Trevor Owens, could have my work be chastised on both sides. Unlike a teacher who would use the technology to augment her 2-dimensional teaching tools of textbooks or a creative designer using the platform for 3-dimensional rendering, I am converting a 3-dimensional object into, at least for my image overlays, into 2-dimensional images with informational text. As one HP Revel user’s review stated, there is a danger of my work becoming a “glorified QR code that were all the rage a few years ago” but are now considered an outmoded tech. This could raise the question of my project’s validity, with traditional academia wondering why I would want to muck about with augmented reality platforms when I could instead draw on the support of the material history community. This is a problem I believe will continue to plague digital historians, much like any new method of historical study that asks recognition and validity from the academy.

The second reading I felt my project responded well to was Colleen Morgan’s Truth and Beauty Bombs. An unfortunate truth that I have learned is that also in the digital there is the danger of corporate influence endangering the ability to perform ‘guerilla’ history. On top of the obvious ‘HP’ Reveal name (the message beign to buy HP, they’re saavy to new tech trends!), I have come across several aura collections belonging to big-name companies using AR technology as a glorified advertising gimmick. On the other hand, different mediums used to convey information can lead to fresh perspectives, and should never be so (blatantly?) dismissed as we tend to do in traditional history. As Owens himself says, "if something helps you see something differently then it's useful".

My final remarks regarding this project and digital history in general is that I have in fact lost some of my skepticism regarding technology, mainly in the fact that I don't have to follow the same patterns of thinking or implementation as others around me; I can use the internet and technology at large to create _what_ I want, _how_ I want. To elaborate, I feel that in a virtual world filled with Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, any users that don't consider themselves technologically literate will simply accept that these social media platforms have rigid structures and coding that cannot be deviated from in any way. This project challenged my perceptions on how society encourages users to approach technologies versus how I could actually use said technologies. To play my own Devil's Advocate, my encounters with AR have not eliminated all of my skepticism. I have to be vigilant for outside influences on my user experience (i.e. who holds corporate sway over the technology, what the platform was designed for, who has access to both user information and the platform itself, etc.), and finally to ask the most obvious question when one is creating: is this the best medium of expression possible for the information/feeling that I am trying to convey?
